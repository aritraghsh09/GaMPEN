The Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) is a novel machine learning framework for estimating the Bayesian posteriors (i.e., values + uncertainties) of morphological parameters for arbitrarily large numbers of galaxies. GaMPEN also automatically crops input galaxy images to an optimal size before morphological parameter estimation. 

GaMPEN can be adapted to work on both ground and space-based imaging; and to predict both parametric and non-parametric estimates of morphology. 

Once trained, it takes GaMPEN less than a milli-second to perform a single model evaluation on a CPU. Thus, GaMPEN's posterior prediction capabilities are ready for large galaxy samples expected from upcoming large imaging surveys, such as Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and NGRST. 

**For a quick read-through of why GaMPEN was developed, what challenges it addresses, and how it works** see this `link <http://www.astro.yale.edu/aghosh/gampen.html>`_


Documentation
-------------
We are actively developing extensive documentation and tutorials for GaMPEN. You can find the current state of our documentation and tutorials at `this link <https://gampen.readthedocs.io/>`_ . We hope to have this fully completed by early Spring 2023. If you are trying to use GaMPEN before that and run into issues, please get in touch! 


Publication 
------------
GaMPEN was initially introduced in this `ApJ paper <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7f9e>`_ 

An updated record of GaMPEN's trained models and catalogs produced are maintained `here <http://gampen.ghosharitra.com/>`_
