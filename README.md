The Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) is a novel
machine learning framework for estimating the Bayesian posteriors (i.e.,
values + uncertainties) of morphological parameters for arbitrarily
large numbers of galaxies. GaMPEN also automatically crops input galaxy
images to an optimal size before morphological parameter estimation.

GaMPEN's predicted uncertainties have been shown to be upto ~60%
more accurate compared to traditional light-profile fitting codes. GaMPEN 
can be adapted to work on both ground and space-based imaging;
and to predict both parametric and non-parametric estimates of
morphology.

Once trained, it takes GaMPEN less than a milli-second to perform a
single model evaluation on a CPU. Thus, GaMPEN's posterior prediction
capabilities are ready for large galaxy samples expected from upcoming
large imaging surveys, such as Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and NGRST.

**For a quick read-through of why GaMPEN was developed, what challenges
it addresses, and how it works** see this

# Documentation

GaMPEN's documentation is available in this repository and also hosted 
on [readthedocs.io](https://gampen.readthedocs.io/) . Although the documentation
is fairly complete; if you are trying to use  GaMPEN and run into issues, 
please get in touch with us!

# Morphology Catalogs
There are multiple structural parameter catalogs that have been created using 
GaMPEN. A few which were generated by GaMPEN's developers are listed below:-

* Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide PDR2 Galaxies 
    * [Paper](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/acd546)
    * [Catalog](https://gampen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Public_data.html#hsc-pdr2-galaxies)
        
* Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide PDR3 AGN Host Galaxies
    * *More details coming soon*

* JWST CEERS Galaxies 
    * *More details coming soon*
