# Tutorials

We have created the following tutorials to get you quickly started with using GaMPEN. To look into the details of each GaMPEN function used in these tutorials, please look at the API reference.

You can either download these notebooks from GitHub and run them on your own machine or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run these using Google GPUs.
