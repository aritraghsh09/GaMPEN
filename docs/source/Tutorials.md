# Tutorials

We have created the following tutorials to get you quickly started with using GaMPEN. To look into the details of each GaMPEN function used in these tutorials, please look at the API reference.

You can either download these notebooks from GitHub and run them on your own machine or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run these using Google GPUs. 

## Making Predictions

This tutorial demonstrates how you can use GaMPEN models to make predictions using two images from our SDSS dataset. 

## Training GaMPEN

This tutorial uses simulated SDSS galaxies to train a GaMPEN model from scratch. 

## Transfer Learning with GaMPEN 

This tutorial uses real SDSS galaxies to perform transfer learning on a GaMPEN model trained only on simulations.
